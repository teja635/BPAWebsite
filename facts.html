                                    <p>Narcotics are opioids and are originally referred to substances that can relieve or dull pain. A common misconception of narcotics is that all drugs are narcotics. This statement is not true and some actual narcotics are listed below to clarify this misconception.
There are two types of narcotics which are man made or occur naturally. Those that come from the natural world comes from poppy papaver somniferum, which is the source of all natural opioids. Those that are man made come from a mixture of chemicals and other harmful substances and form destructive substances such as methadone, fentanyl, and meperidine. <br>
The effect of narcotics on the body affects the mind and body itself. Its psychological effects is physiological dependence which means the mind will depend on the use of these drugs as a coping mechanism when the environment is too stressful for the individual. Its effects on the body include but are not limited to constriction of the pupils, flushing of the face and neck, nausea, vomiting, and slowed breathing. The body will become dependent on the drugs and withdrawal will become physically harder if drug use is discontinued. Some of the severe withdrawal symptoms are severe depression, chills alternating with flushing, and excessive sweating, and restlessness. <br>
There are five classes of narcotics ranging from Schedule I to Schedule V narcotics. Schedule I narcotics have no medical use and are illegal to sell, purchase, and use in the United States. If caught doing any of these activities with the drug then it will result in a fine up to five million dollars and imprisonment from five to forty years on the first offense. Two or more offenses will result in a fine up to ten million dollars and anywhere between ten years to life in imprisonment.

                    <div class="panel-body"><p>Stimulants are drugs that speed up the body’s systems. And come in all shapes and sizes in the forms of capsules and powder. When large doses are consumed, users reach a high and only stop use when they have either ran out or have reached a state of psychosis and physical exhaustion. When under the influence of stimulants, users try their best to recreate that same rush that they have felt when the drug first entered their system. <br>
The effect of stimulants on the mind is to create a sense of exhilaration, but have negative side effects as well. These include aggression, suicidal and homicidal tendencies, and hallucinations may occur while under the influence. These drugs cause the mind to become more dependent on the drug as a coping mechanism. The effect of the drug on the body is that it is supposed to reverse the effect of fatigue on both mental and physical tasks. But these drugs can cause abdominal cramps, tremors, excessive vomiting, and chest pain and palpitations. Overdose of the drug may result in convulsions and cardiovascular collapse resulting in death. 
Stimulants have no medical use and are therefore illegal to purchase, sell, and use in the United States. If caught doing any of these activities then the punishment will be the same as the punishment with purchasing, selling, and using narcotics.

                        be fatal and many cases have reported of deaths because of inhalants.
